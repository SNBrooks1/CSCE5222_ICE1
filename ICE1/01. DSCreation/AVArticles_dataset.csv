Will anyone want ? Washington , DC ( CNN ) Jaime Waydo spent years building self-driving cars Waymo , quick praise abilities . The cars already experience 300 years average driving experience , said 2017 interview . Waymo 's self-driving cars could see 360 degrees , noted , humans could see 120 degrees . `` [ The cars ] also see two football fields away , significantly better vision I probably , '' Waydo told interviewer 2017 . But recent interview CNN Business , Waydo spoke challenges limits self-driving cars , like identifying puddles , seeing clearly sun low horizon . She said years working self-driving showed unusual things happen roads , make difficult even advanced artificial intelligence react appropriately myriad new scenarios might encounter . A Waymo self-driving car saw baby crawling road , recalled . ( The baby fine , according Waydo . ) Waydo , left role lead systems engineer Waymo 2018 work autonomous systems Apple , joining Cavnue , startup making digital infrastructure intended help self-driving cars understand roads , actually drive better human . A US Department Transportation illustration shows vehicle infrastructure technology designed function improve road safety . Roads , signs traffic lights designed governments expected humans would drive cars . A bright green light may easiest way tell human 's safe drive ahead , self-driving car may better information messaged radio cellular network . As task developing rolling self-driving cars started look slower difficult expected , autonomous driving executives like Waydo increasingly warming idea retrofitting infrastructure get roads faster . But critics say technology unproven costs could expensive governments already struggling cost simple road upkeep , like filling potholes . Read More For years , self-driving car companies operated belief technology current road infrastructure would enough , cars would n't need dedicated vehicle-to-infrastructure technology , traffic lights broadcast color directly vehicle 's computer , cameras mounted blind turns light posts get crucial information cars , like cyclist approaching . But self-driving proved harder get ground expected . Companies missed deadlines deployments . The industry consolidated , even company big Uber selling self-driving vehicle program . Other startups shut sold big tech companies . Jaime Waydo , longtime self-driving car engineer , joined Cavnue develop smart technology help autonomous vehicles drive safe . Waydo wants self-driving technology spread broadly people like father , said lives rural area Parkinson 's Disease , benefit technology . ( Waymo , owned Google parent company Alphabet , operates self-driving robotaxi service part Phoenix , Arizona , n't expanded across country . ) She 's alone coming around merits smart infrastructure . Michael Fleming , CEO self-driving truck company Torc Robotics , Daimler owns majority stake , said company expects announce smart infrastructure partnerships year . He 's working autonomous vehicles since competing 2004 government-sponsored race 's widely credited kicking self-driving car industry . `` There lot uncertainty far technical solutions made amount sense , '' Fleming told CNN Business . `` When first started really n't know . Today , I 'm convinced . '' Michigan plans redesign stretch road self-driving cars He says smart infrastructure , like traffic signal broadcasts color , advantage simpler artificial intelligence algorithms companies use perceive things like red green lights . Waydo recalled Waymo expanded Texas , adjust traffic lights horizontal , requiring work engineers . With smart infrastructure , said , traffic lights seem self-driving cars , making easier launch cars new places . Eryk Nice , vice president technology strategy Hyundai 's self-driving venture Motional , believer smart infrastructure speed fast self-driving cars arrive public . For example , self-driving vehicles struggle navigate parking garages , sensors mounted garage could tell cars exactly . Vehicle-to infrastructure technology ambitious goal . Cavnue competitors develop cost-effective sensors hung along roadsides capable communicating nearby cars . Maintenance costs need manageable . The company said 's planning technology cheaper cost lighting roadway . Waydo declined say specifically type sensors may used . But critics holding ground . Kyle Vogt , founder Cruise , GM 's self-driving operation , said 2014 , `` job [ vehicle-to-infrastructure ] right , probably look new one . '' Vogt described hurdles technology proving works installation , getting local communities support installing convincing local governments pay . Cruise spokeswoman Tiffany Testo told CNN Business Vogt 's views n't changed . She pointed progress self-driving cars compared smart infrastructure indication 's needed . Vogt n't alone concerns . Paul Godsmark , co-founder Canadian Automated Vehicle Centre Excellence , recalled US federal government pushed connecting cars infrastructure via short-range radios , auto industry n't embrace technology . `` The [ Department Transportation ] backed wrong horse , '' Godsmark said . `` We know tech moves faster public sector . '' Chandler , Arizona , home Waymo 's self-driving ridehail service , says n't installed infrastructure especially self-driving cars . Micah Miranda , Chandler 's economic development director , told CNN Business currently technology seems like inefficient use capital self-driving vehicles n't used broadly , 's unclear infrastructure technology would best n't standardized . `` Tearing roads , light poles , kind stuff , cost infrastructure expensive , '' Miranda said . `` We make sure capital dollars going serving broadest portion population transportation needs . '' The largest players self-driving — Waymo , Cruise , Aurora , acquired Uber 's self-driving arm — say vehicles n't rely smart infrastructure today . They also declined say believe smart infrastructure would speed ability deploy self-driving cars cities . But Waymo 's parent company Alphabet may hedging bets . Cavnue founded Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners , funded Alphabet . In February , Cavnue selected help alleviate congestion Maryland highway outside Washington DC , Interstate 270 . Cavnue work project Australian infrastructure company Transurban , selected Maryland Department Transportation chose Cavnue . Rob Deans , Transurban 's vice president technology , said company impressed Cavnue 's experience connected autonomous vehicles . `` Autonomous vehicles probably single biggest change coming transport , '' told CNN Business . `` I think opportunity leverage Alphabet , leader subsidiary spinout , Waymo . '' Waymo part Cavnue 's advisory team smart road project outside Detroit . Cavnue CEO Tyler Duvall said business model may rely tolls road access , payments road n't congested . Cavnue 's team small today , 14 people , according Duvall . But plans grow , said 's finding significant interest , conversations eight governments . `` There 's insatiable interest innovation , '' said transportation officials . `` It 's build team fast enough bring idea .

Many hope AI transform economy ways drive growth , similar steam engines late 19 th century electricity early 20 th century . But hard imagine maps smart phones , chatbots , existing AI-enabled services drive type economic growth saw stream electricity . What need see dramatic new AI-enabled products services transform way life—in short , waiting AI “ killer app . ” Robert Seamans Associate Professor Director Center Future Management - Stern School Business , NYU RobSeamans Autonomous vehicles ( AVs ) —vehicles accelerate , brake , turn , requiring little input human driver—may killer app transforms economy significantly . AI supports AVs variety ways , including quickly processing interpreting large amounts data generated vehicle ’ cameras sensors helping improve vehicle fuel efficiency safety . The impacts broad adoption AVs equally numerous , potentially lowering transportation costs limiting need drivers possibly transforming mobility urban suburban environments . While relative timing scale economic growth yet clear—and subject debate among scholars—a key step maximizing benefits AVs passing federal legislation , rather relying patchwork state local guidelines . To inform debate help prepare policymakers task hand , report examine state AVs , potential become “ killer app ” broad impacts , existing potential regulations could ensure net positive effects economy society whole . The current state future AVs The current standards autonomous driving developed Society Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) . According SAE standard , automation capability vehicles ranges Level 0 , autonomy , Level 5 , full automation . Level 1 features include park assist , lane assist adaptive cruise control . Some Level 3 vehicles , include full self-driving capabilities require human intervention complex situations traffic jams , may commercially available 2021 . No Level 4 5 cars , would require human intervention , yet certified use regular roads , though Google ’ Waymo development . While potential impacts AVs substantial , take time realized ; AVs still years commercially available , let alone widespread use . To give reasonable sense timing , Chris Urmson —a DARPA challenge winner , head Google ’ Waymo autonomous vehicle unit many years , CEO self-driving vehicle software company named Aurora —argues may take 30 50 years widespread adoption autonomous vehicles . Despite predictions contrary—e.g. , Elon Musk ’ 2019 prediction would Tesla driverless taxi fleet regions 2020—time frames magnitude common automobile industry . Choe , Oettl Seamans ( 2021 ) report widespread adoption new innovations automobile sector historically take several decades . 1 There number factors contribute technology adoption , even new technology feasible , may available price point many consumers pay . For example , turbo-charged engines , help reduce amount fuel needed , start become popular oil prices started rise 1970s . In short , timing adoption AVs economic impacts follow depend many factors . For regulators policymakers interested shaping likely considerable economic societal impacts AVs , time . Effect economy society Supporters autonomous vehicles argue may provide variety benefits including fuel efficiency safety . Indeed , Brookings Institution recently published book topic ( Winston Karpilow , 2020 ) . 2 The U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) argues AVs fuel efficient human-driven cars , means fewer emissions . However , AVs may increase vehicle traffic , potentially nullifying emissions reduction fuel efficiency . Kroger , Kuhnimhof , Trommer ( 2019 ) project adoption autonomous vehicle technologies may increase vehicle traffic 2-9 percent result new automobile user groups well lower generalized costs car travel . 3 AVs likely safer human-driven cars , large part reducing human error National Highway Traffic Safety Association ( NHTSA ) estimates accounts 94 percent crashes . While widespread adoption AVs ultimately result safer roads , several high profile accidents involving AVs , Waymo van crashed car Arizona . Perhaps result high-profile accidents , consumer demand AVs seems relatively low . According 2021 survey American Automobile Association , 14 percent drivers report would trust riding vehicle drives , response similar 2020 survey . It possible , however , consumer attitudes change Level 4 5 vehicles become commercially available . AVs may help reduce labor input costs driving-intensive industries . However , Gittleman Monaco ( 2017 ) point , several types drivers , autonomous driving likely affect types others . 4 Autonomous vehicles likely used heavy tractor trailer truck purposes ( aka “ long haul ” ) local delivery given relative ease navigating highways tasks associated local delivery , including freight handling , paperwork , customer service . Gittleman Monaco estimate Level 4 5 automation may ultimately displace 300,000 400,000 drivers . But authors highlight many practical limitations automation . For example , highlight one important functions truck driver serve security guard freight . A recent paper Gelauff , Ossokina , Teulings ( 2019 ) envisions longer-term outcomes AVs . 5 The authors model two countervailing effects AVs , lead differing outcomes population distribution . On one hand , AVs may lead improved use time car trips , lowers cost living distance cities . On hand , AVs may lead improved public transit options urban environments form shared-ride autonomous vehicles ( SAVs ) . The authors argue SAVs may efficient existing public transit may make city living relatively attractive leading population clustering cities . The authors argue second effect may outweigh first ultimately may lead overall population shifts towards large , attractive cities expense smaller urban non-urban areas . While authors ’ speculate ultimate economic effects change , worth noting literature economic geography suggests many agglomeration effects living close cities , including greater economic growth innovation . 6 It also worth noting COVID-19 pandemic led large shift population away many urban environments , least short run . In short , AVs likely affect economy society variety ways . AVs may lead fewer emissions increased safety . By decreasing need humans drive , AVs likely transform type work done humans transportation sector economy may also change way humans commute work . How plays , however , depends numerous factors including , importantly , existing future regulations . Current prospective AV legislation The National Conference State Legislatures highlights number states introduced enacted laws related autonomous vehicles . Notably , December 2020 , California State Senator Ben Allen introduced bill establish new Council Future Transportation California would promote state legislation autonomous vehicles , addition transportation-related policy . Also , November 2020 California Public Utilities Commission approved autonomous vehicle regulatory framework would make easier companies provide autonomous vehicle transportation services public . While laws indicate state legislators responsive local concerns autonomous vehicles , risk resulting patchwork state laws . With concern mind , attempts federal legislation , notably 2017 SELF DRIVE Act House AV START Act Senate . The SELF DRIVE Act ( Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment Research In Vehicle Evolution Act ) passed House 2017 advance Senate . The bill would provided NHTSA authority regulate AVs . NHTSA would authorized require safety assessment certifications states would preempted enacting laws regarding design , construction , performance AVs unless laws enact standards identical federal standards . In addition , bill would required manufacturers AVs develop written cybersecurity privacy plans vehicles prior offering sale . The AV START Act ( American Vision Safer Transportation Advancement Revolutionary Technologies Act ) introduced Senate 2017 advance . Like SELF DRIVE Act , would established framework federal role oversight AVs , preempting state laws providing clarity stakeholders including car manufacturers insurance companies .

So autonomous vehicles lagging ? Clifford Winston Tuesday , March 9 , 2021 It remains seen federal legislation AVs passed , although promising signs . Reportedly , currently bipartisan support federal legislation , notably Republican Senator John Thune Democratic Senator Gary Peters ( co-sponsors AV START Act ) . While Biden administration mention autonomous vehicles recently proposed infrastructure jobs plan ( instead focusing electric vehicles charging stations ) , Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg stated , “ Automated vehicle technology coming , ’ advancing quickly , something holds potential transformative , I think many ways policy kept up. ” Existing regulatory barriers : Spectrum One important issue resolved around communication standards autonomous vehicles . The 5.9 GHz spectrum , 75 MHz band , initially set aside use vehicle-to-vehicle ( V2V ) communications 1999 , NHTSA , car manufacturers , device manufacturers spent ensuing two decades working standard V2V communications . However , standard emerged , called Dedicated Short-Range Communications ( DSRC ) , continues face considerable resistance , including competing standard called Cellular-Vehicle-to-Vehicle ( C-V2V ) . DSRC allows direct communication two DSRC-enabled devices without relying intermediary , cellular network , principle makes fast deployable areas without cellular coverage . However , research Gyawali et al ( 2020 ) suggests DSRC works well two vehicles sight moving fast . 7 C-V2V operates cellular network , may limit ability function well remote areas handles communications vehicles moving quickly ( Gyawali et al 2020 ) . Separately , Wi-Fi demands growing , 5.9 GHz spectrum increasingly used unlicensed Wi-Fi . A 2018 study Rand Corporation estimated value consumer producer surplus using entire band Wi-Fi $ 82.2 billion $ 189.9 billion . In November 2019 Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) Chairman Ajit Pai announced plan whereby 45 MHz lower end band made available Wi-Fi , next 20 MHz C-V2V , top 10 MHz potentially C-V2V DSRC . In November 2020 FCC voted favor proposal , despite objections Trump administration ’ Department Transportation . There calls Biden administration reverse FCC ’ decision . The plan would seem bolster C-V2V standard relative DSRC , may hasten resolution standards battle , also favors use Wi-Fi transportation . It important policymakers consider tradeoffs associated use spectrum . On one hand , demand spectrum Wi-Fi enabled devices growing current need . In contrast , currently little need spectrum autonomous vehicles—there ’ commercially available consumer demand seems low . On hand , spectrum autonomous vehicles likely future need , economic benefits autonomous vehicles may outweigh benefits additional Wi-Fi . Conclusion Autonomous vehicles likely transform economy , including changing role humans transportation-related industries potentially reducing emissions increasing safety , ultimately lead economic growth . However , large-scale adoption autonomous vehicles ensuing economic growth likely take time . The technology still development consumers remain wary autonomous vehicles . Moreover , federal state legislation still nascent , competing standards communication vehicles .
