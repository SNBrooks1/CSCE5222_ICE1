Will anyone want ? Washington , DC ( CNN ) Jaime Waydo spent years building self-driving cars Waymo , quick praise abilities . The cars already experience 300 years average driving experience , said 2017 interview . Waymo 's self-driving cars could see 360 degrees , noted , humans could see 120 degrees . `` [ The cars ] also see two football fields away , significantly better vision I probably , '' Waydo told interviewer 2017 . But recent interview CNN Business , Waydo spoke challenges limits self-driving cars , like identifying puddles , seeing clearly sun low horizon . She said years working self-driving showed unusual things happen roads , make difficult even advanced artificial intelligence react appropriately myriad new scenarios might encounter . A Waymo self-driving car saw baby crawling road , recalled . ( The baby fine , according Waydo . ) Waydo , left role lead systems engineer Waymo 2018 work autonomous systems Apple , joining Cavnue , startup making digital infrastructure intended help self-driving cars understand roads , actually drive better human . A US Department Transportation illustration shows vehicle infrastructure technology designed function improve road safety . Roads , signs traffic lights designed governments expected humans would drive cars . A bright green light may easiest way tell human 's safe drive ahead , self-driving car may better information messaged radio cellular network . As task developing rolling self-driving cars started look slower difficult expected , autonomous driving executives like Waydo increasingly warming idea retrofitting infrastructure get roads faster . But critics say technology unproven costs could expensive governments already struggling cost simple road upkeep , like filling potholes . Read More For years , self-driving car companies operated belief technology current road infrastructure would enough , cars would n't need dedicated vehicle-to-infrastructure technology , traffic lights broadcast color directly vehicle 's computer , cameras mounted blind turns light posts get crucial information cars , like cyclist approaching . But self-driving proved harder get ground expected . Companies missed deadlines deployments . The industry consolidated , even company big Uber selling self-driving vehicle program . Other startups shut sold big tech companies . Jaime Waydo , longtime self-driving car engineer , joined Cavnue develop smart technology help autonomous vehicles drive safe . Waydo wants self-driving technology spread broadly people like father , said lives rural area Parkinson 's Disease , benefit technology . ( Waymo , owned Google parent company Alphabet , operates self-driving robotaxi service part Phoenix , Arizona , n't expanded across country . ) She 's alone coming around merits smart infrastructure . Michael Fleming , CEO self-driving truck company Torc Robotics , Daimler owns majority stake , said company expects announce smart infrastructure partnerships year . He 's working autonomous vehicles since competing 2004 government-sponsored race 's widely credited kicking self-driving car industry . `` There lot uncertainty far technical solutions made amount sense , '' Fleming told CNN Business . `` When first started really n't know . Today , I 'm convinced . '' Michigan plans redesign stretch road self-driving cars He says smart infrastructure , like traffic signal broadcasts color , advantage simpler artificial intelligence algorithms companies use perceive things like red green lights . Waydo recalled Waymo expanded Texas , adjust traffic lights horizontal , requiring work engineers . With smart infrastructure , said , traffic lights seem self-driving cars , making easier launch cars new places . Eryk Nice , vice president technology strategy Hyundai 's self-driving venture Motional , believer smart infrastructure speed fast self-driving cars arrive public . For example , self-driving vehicles struggle navigate parking garages , sensors mounted garage could tell cars exactly . Vehicle-to infrastructure technology ambitious goal . Cavnue competitors develop cost-effective sensors hung along roadsides capable communicating nearby cars . Maintenance costs need manageable . The company said 's planning technology cheaper cost lighting roadway . Waydo declined say specifically type sensors may used . But critics holding ground . Kyle Vogt , founder Cruise , GM 's self-driving operation , said 2014 , `` job [ vehicle-to-infrastructure ] right , probably look new one . '' Vogt described hurdles technology proving works installation , getting local communities support installing convincing local governments pay . Cruise spokeswoman Tiffany Testo told CNN Business Vogt 's views n't changed . She pointed progress self-driving cars compared smart infrastructure indication 's needed . Vogt n't alone concerns . Paul Godsmark , co-founder Canadian Automated Vehicle Centre Excellence , recalled US federal government pushed connecting cars infrastructure via short-range radios , auto industry n't embrace technology . `` The [ Department Transportation ] backed wrong horse , '' Godsmark said . `` We know tech moves faster public sector . '' Chandler , Arizona , home Waymo 's self-driving ridehail service , says n't installed infrastructure especially self-driving cars . Micah Miranda , Chandler 's economic development director , told CNN Business currently technology seems like inefficient use capital self-driving vehicles n't used broadly , 's unclear infrastructure technology would best n't standardized . `` Tearing roads , light poles , kind stuff , cost infrastructure expensive , '' Miranda said . `` We make sure capital dollars going serving broadest portion population transportation needs . '' The largest players self-driving — Waymo , Cruise , Aurora , acquired Uber 's self-driving arm — say vehicles n't rely smart infrastructure today . They also declined say believe smart infrastructure would speed ability deploy self-driving cars cities . But Waymo 's parent company Alphabet may hedging bets . Cavnue founded Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners , funded Alphabet . In February , Cavnue selected help alleviate congestion Maryland highway outside Washington DC , Interstate 270 . Cavnue work project Australian infrastructure company Transurban , selected Maryland Department Transportation chose Cavnue . Rob Deans , Transurban 's vice president technology , said company impressed Cavnue 's experience connected autonomous vehicles . `` Autonomous vehicles probably single biggest change coming transport , '' told CNN Business . `` I think opportunity leverage Alphabet , leader subsidiary spinout , Waymo . '' Waymo part Cavnue 's advisory team smart road project outside Detroit . Cavnue CEO Tyler Duvall said business model may rely tolls road access , payments road n't congested . Cavnue 's team small today , 14 people , according Duvall . But plans grow , said 's finding significant interest , conversations eight governments . `` There 's insatiable interest innovation , '' said transportation officials . `` It 's build team fast enough bring idea .
